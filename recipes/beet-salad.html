    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium beets - scrubbed, trimmed, and cut in half</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen orange juice concentrate</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place beets into a saucepan; add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then cook for 20 to 30 minutes, 
            until tender. Drain and cool, then cut into cubes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While beets are cooking, place walnuts in a skillet over medium-low heat. Heat until warm and starting to toast. 
            Stir in maple syrup; cook and stir until evenly coated, then remove from heat and set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the dressing: Whisk orange juice concentrate, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil together in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a large helping of baby greens onto each of four salad plates, divide candied walnuts equally and sprinkle over greens. 
            Place equal amounts of beets over greens and top with pieces of goat cheese. Drizzle dressing over each salad.
